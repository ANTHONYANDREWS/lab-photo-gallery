## Deliverables

All the files in the these folders provided in the starter code, with the necessary code to satisfy the requirements described below.

## Introduction

In this lesson we are going to work with Angular for the first time. The goal here is to work on three small projects where you can practice the concepts we've learned thus far.

## Starter Code

To generate the starter code, follow the steps given below

- To create a new application,
    - Open your ubuntu or cmd terminal and execute the following command
      - ```ng new app-name```
      - for example, ng new super-wars
    - To create a new component, execute the command 
      - ``` ng generate component component-name```
      - example, ng generate component contacts
      
## How to run

- To run the project go to your ubuntu terminal or VScode editor
    - open the ubuntu or cmd terminal or inside the vscode editor
    - run the command following command
    - ```ng serve --open or ng serve -o```


## PROGRESSION #1: PHOTO GALLERY

In the first iteration we are going to build a photo album. Imagine you have an album at home. On it, you can find a photo and its description. This is what we are going to build.

We will build this album in the `AppComponent` component. The album will have three photos and their descriptions, and **it's not necessary to have an array to store these values**.

Easy, right? Add some styles to the page to give your photo album a little flair!


/Happy coding!
