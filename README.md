## PROGRESSION #1: Photo Gallery

In the first iteration we are going to build a photo album. Imagine you have an album at home. On it, you can find a photo and its description. This is what we are going to build.

Easy, right? Add some styles to the page to give your photo album a little flair!

/Happy coding!
